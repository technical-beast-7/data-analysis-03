# 🛒 E-commerce SQL Analysis

## 📌 Objective
Use SQL queries to extract and analyze data from an e-commerce database using MySQL. This project demonstrates querying, joining, aggregating, and optimizing data using various SQL techniques.

---

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0
- **Interface**: MySQL Workbench
- **Script**: `ecommerce_analysis.sql`
- **Dataset**: Simulated e-commerce schema with customers, products, orders, and order details

---

## 📁 Files
- `ecommerce_analysis.sql`: Contains schema creation, sample data insertion, and all required SQL queries
- `README.md`: Task overview and instructions
- `screenshots/`: Folder containing screenshots of query outputs from MySQL Workbench

---

## 📚 Concepts Used
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- `JOINs` (INNER, LEFT)
- Subqueries
- Aggregate functions: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`
- Views (`CREATE VIEW`)
- Query optimization with `INDEX`

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open **MySQL Workbench**
2. Run the full `ecommerce_analysis.sql` script to:
   - Create the schema and tables
   - Insert sample data
   - Execute analysis queries
3. View and capture **screenshots of the result grids**
4. Paste the screenshots into a `.docx` or `.pdf` for submission

---

## 📸 Deliverables
- ✅ `ecommerce_analysis.sql`
- ✅ `screenshots/` of each query's output
- ✅ This `README.md` file

---

## ✅ Outcome
Gain hands-on experience with structured data querying, joining relational tables, writing subqueries, creating views, and optimizing query performance using indexes.
